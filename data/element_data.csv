# Add more elements as needed... Note: Crystal structures and lattice params can be phase/temp dependent. These are common room temp values.
# Thermal conductivity can also vary widely.
# Manganese has a complex structure (alpha-Mn), BCC is a high-temp phase but sometimes used conceptually in HEA models. Lattice param here is for alpha-Mn 'a'. Be cautious!
